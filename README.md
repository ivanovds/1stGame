# Course Work of 2nd semester in IASA (KPI)
# task: to create a programm using C++
# I`ve created a game "Dots and Boxes" using C++ and SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library).
# rules: Starting with an empty grid of dots, two players take turns adding a single horizontal 
# or vertical line between two unjoined adjacent dots. The player who completes the fourth side of
# a 1Ã—1 box earns one point and takes another turn. The game ends when no more lines can be placed. 
# The winner is the player with the most points.
